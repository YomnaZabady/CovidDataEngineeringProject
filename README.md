Steps:

Using cloudera virtual machine, raw data was imported into hadoop and using oozie to automate the process, hive scripts was done to import the data to table format where staging, partitionning and data wrangling is made.
This all to produce the final output table that will hold the data for the top 10 countries that had the most deaths per 1 million and the most tests per 1 one million.
The final output table data has been taken on power bi to viualize the data in different forms.
